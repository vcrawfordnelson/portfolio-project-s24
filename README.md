# Senior Data Science Portfolio Project, Belmont University - Spring 2024

## Project Outline
This project explores the relationship between the glycemic index (GI) and oxalate contents of commonly consumed American foods.  Existing research tends to evaluate these aspects of food in isolation, ather than in tandem.  However, foods with high oxalate levels and with high glycemic index levels have both been linked to adverse health outcomes when consumed in large quantities.  This project seeks to identify overlap between these tow food groups and help consumes make more informed dietary choices.
